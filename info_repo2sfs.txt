How to make your own 64bit Google Chrome Browser squashfs module

Get the repo2sfs tool from Page 1, dated 2018-02-23+. If you are new to this, do the test-run first.

Now for Chrome - you will need a non-root user:

In the System Tools menu, run Add New User
Create a user named "guest" with password "guest"
Accept the default list of groups, especially Audio

Download Chrome:
Code:	
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb	

Extract the chrome-guest-setup script attached below.

Because you are working with a 3rd-party Debian package, you will run repo2sfs a bit differently:
Start in an empty folder holding the repo2sfs script, the chrome-guest-setup script and the Chrome .deb package.

Open a teminal (F4) and type: ./repo2sfs google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb (Hint: use Tab completion)

Part-way through, you will get this dialog:
Code:	
In the next step, the package will be temporarily removed ...
Press Enter to continue:	

Continue the build.
Stop at the pause for "fix anything in /tmp/repo2sfs".
Open another terminal and run the chrome-guest-setup script.

Finish the build.
Load the module and run Google Chrome from the Internet menu.
